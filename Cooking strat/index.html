                <h3>Fast Food</h3>
                <p>Is fast food unhealthy?
                    While some foods are healthier than others, there is no such thing as a “bad” food. Different foods can serve different purposes, but they are all providing us with energy and nutrients that our body needs. For example, pizza contains nutrients such as carbohydrates, protein, fat, calcium, and others depending on the toppings.
