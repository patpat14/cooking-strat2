            <p> We are developing a cooking navigation system, which helps even a novice user to cook several recipes in
                parallel without failure, while improving an advanced user's skill further. To realize this, the system
                optimizes the cooking procedure considering the following restrictions: (1) Duration of cooking, (2)
                Accuracy of cooking, and (3) Learning effect, by providing appropriate instructions to user's at the
                right timing, making full use of multimedia information. The users should be able to cook perfectly and
                comfortably just by following the text, video and audio provided by the system. According to the result
                of a preliminary experiment, all users from novice to experienced cooks could finish two dishes in
                parallel while enjoyeing the cooking very much. The result of a questionnaire shows the effectiveness of
                the multimedia navigation that we propose.
